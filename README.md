**TO GET STARTED:** 
To begin this application, in your terminal, cd into the backend folder and run `bundle install` to ensure all necessary gems are being applied. Then, while still in the terminal (and the backend), run `rails db:migrate` as well as `rails db:seed` to set up the database. Now, to get the application running in a window, you will need to run your server with `rails s`. Finally, cd into the frontend folder and run `open index.html` to get the application open and running in an internet tab.
