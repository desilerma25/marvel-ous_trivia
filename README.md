*DESCRIPTION:*
 Web application that allows the user to create a workout routine with exercises from the seeded data or a user can create a new exercise for their workout. A user can also enter a specific number and sets and reps for each exercise.

*TO GET STARTED:* 
To begin this application, in your terminal, cd into the backend folder and run "bundle install" to ensure all necessary gems are being applied. Then, while still in the terminal (and the backend), run "rails db:migrate" as well as "rails db:seed" to set up the database. Now, to get the application running in a window, you will need to run your server with "rails s". Finally, cd into the frontend folder and run "open index.html" to get the application open and running in an internet tab.
